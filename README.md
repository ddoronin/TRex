# &lt;T>Rex

MVC project that is build around an idea of state incapsulated into UI widgets rather than having a shared global state like in Redux.

Redux is awesome, but for me there are several drawbacks that make application changes too complicated:

1. State shape should be well defined. Shape refactoring could be error prone.

2. Deep state is hard to modify.

3. Not easy to implement workflows.
